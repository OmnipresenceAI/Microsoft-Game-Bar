# Removal: Announcement
>“With continued, great feedback from the community and after careful consideration, we have decided to remove Mixer from Xbox Game Bar to focus on delivering new, more often requested experiences across Mixer, Windows 10 and the Xbox Game Bar. You can broadcast to Mixer from Windows 10 devices using third-party tools such as OBS, Streamlabs, and XSplit and continue to use Xbox Game Bar for screen capture and sharing, controlling your music and audio settings, finding new teammates with Looking for Group (LFG), and chatting with Xbox friends across Xbox console, mobile, and PC – all without leaving your game.”
